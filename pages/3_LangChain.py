  st.write("RAG, or Retrieval-Augmented Generation- within the context of a language model chatbot, refers to a technique that enhances the chatbot's ability to generate responses by integrating a retrieval component with a generative model. This approach allows the chatbot to pull in relevant information or context from a large database or set of documents in real-time, and then use this information to inform the generation of its responses. The retrieval component helps the chatbot to provide more accurate, informative, and contextually relevant answers by leveraging external knowledge sources, thereby improving the overall quality and utility of its interactions.")
